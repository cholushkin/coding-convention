## Overview

`Coding convention.md` outlines a coding convention that integrates industry-standard practices with Unity-specific considerations. Its purpose is to promote readability, maintainability, and effective team collaboration across the codebase.
All specific coding style decisions are discussed and evaluated with the assistance of AI trained on a broad corpus of real-world software. This helps ensure that our conventions reflect common, well-established practices observed across the wider programming community—not just isolated personal preferences.


## Core Mindset Principles
Consistency is more valuable than perfection.
The strength of any coding convention lies in its consistent application. Favor uniformity across the project over individual stylistic preferences. Refrain from prolonged debates over trivial formatting details—consistency serves the team better than subjective ideals.

## Write code for humans, not just machines.
While performance matters, clarity should never be sacrificed unnecessarily. Code should be expressive and concise, conveying intent clearly to fellow developers. However, avoid dogmatism—elegance is useful, but pragmatism is essential.

## Favor clarity over cleverness.
If a piece of code looks smart but is difficult to understand at a glance, it's a liability. Prioritize transparent logic and intuitive structure, even at the cost of a few extra lines.
Assume that someone else will need to read, modify, or debug your code—possibly months later, or under pressure. Write in a way that helps them succeed.
